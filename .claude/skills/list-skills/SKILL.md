Show the user's skills as boards. The terum-skills CLI renders them with `--format md`; the board it prints is the answer.

Arguments: everything after the command (in Claude Code this arrives as "$ARGUMENTS"). `--local` shows only your Library, `--team` only the team Marketplace, and `--team <name>` names a configured team (passed through unchanged); with no arguments show both.

## Command

Run with your shell tool, from the current working directory:

    npx -y terum-skills@latest ls --local --format md
    npx -y terum-skills@latest ls --format md

With `--local`, run only the first; with `--team`, only the second; with `--team <name>`, only the second with `--team <name>` appended. Add `--rows all` to either when the user asks for every row.

## Before

Nothing to confirm: both commands only read this machine and the local team clone.

## After

Show each board verbatim as the answer; do not re-summarise unless asked. The board's **Next:** line holds the follow-ups to offer. On a machine with no team the second command fails: the board carries a `> ❌ No team is configured on this machine.` block with the two get-started lines and exits 1. That is a result — say in one sentence that there is no team yet and show the Library board from the first command. If a board carries a **Notes** or `> ❌` failure block naming a hand-off, say plainly "run this in a terminal" and give the command.

## Rules

- No TTY: never pipe `y`, never drive the CLI with `expect`, never add `--frames` to dodge a question. A question the CLI asks means the verb belongs in a terminal: say so and hand over the command.
- Never use the skill-file `` !`command` `` injection; run every command with your shell tool and read its output.
- Do not `cd`; run from the current working directory and pass absolute paths.
- Exit 1 is a result, not a retry: show the failure block, do not re-run, and do not claim earlier steps were rolled back.

## Sandbox

When `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` is set, add `--prefer-offline` after `npx` (`npx --prefer-offline -y terum-skills@latest …`) so a cached package resolves without the registry; if npx still reports a network error, ask the user to run the command in a terminal. In that sandbox the verbs that need the network — `sync`, `install`, `publish`, `invite`, `eval`, and `update`'s release probe — are handed to a terminal with the reason.
